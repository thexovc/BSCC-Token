# BSCC Token
This is a ERC20 token deployed on the binance smart chain with functions such as ```mintToken``` which enables a user to mint token and save their transactions in a mapping which is then displayed in the transaction page.

The frontend of this project helps a user interact with the ```mintToken``` function where the user specifies the amount to token he/she want to purchase and then pay a fee depending on the amountof tokens entered.

The fee is 0.02 BNB per 10000 tokens minted.
